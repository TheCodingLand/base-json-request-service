# base-json-request-service

Just a simple python container for other uses.

- Imports a class to serve as a model from project.models

- Dummy request function with serializing to json


Planned usage :

1 - Add a loop to main.py to read data from somewhere (log file, csv, listen from flask API...) 


2 - create objects, send json request to an api.

  OR

3 - Pass it to a message queue (RabbitMQ, Redis)
